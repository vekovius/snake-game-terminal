# Snake Game for Terminal 🐍

A simple, classic Snake game that you can play directly in your Mac Terminal! This project was developed as a fun, interactive way to practice Python and bring the classic Snake game to life in a text-based format.

## About the Game

In this version of Snake, you control a snake to eat as much food as possible and grow longer. Avoid hitting the walls or the snake’s own tail, or the game will end.

### Controls
- Use the **arrow keys** to control the snake's direction.
- Your goal is to "eat" the food items that appear randomly on the screen to make the snake grow longer.
- Be careful not to collide with the walls or the snake's own body, or it's game over!

## How to Download and Play

### Step 1: Install Python (if you don't have it)

Most Macs come with Python pre-installed. To check if Python is installed:
1. Open the **Terminal** app (you can find it in Applications > Utilities).
2. Type the following command and press **Enter**:

   ```bash
   python3 --version
3. If you see a version number like Python 3.x.x, you’re ready to go! If you see an error, download Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/ and follow the installation instructions.

Step 2: Download the Snake Game Code

	1.	Go to this GitHub repository and download the game files:
	•	Click the green Code button at the top of this page.
	•	Select Download ZIP.
	2.	Unzip the downloaded file. You should see a folder named something like snake-game-terminal-main.

Step 3: Run the Game

	1.	Open the Terminal app again.
	2.	In the Terminal, type cd  (with a space after cd).
	3.	Drag the unzipped folder (e.g., snake-game-terminal-main) from Finder into the Terminal window to automatically insert the path.
	4.	Press Enter to navigate to the game folder.
	5.	Run the following command to start the game:python3 snake.py                                   
 	6.	Use the arrow keys to play. Try to eat the food and avoid crashing into the walls or yourself!

Step 4: Quit the Game

To quit the game at any time, simply close the Terminal window or press Ctrl + C in the Terminal.
